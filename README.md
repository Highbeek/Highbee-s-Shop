# Highbee-s-Shop
React Ecommerce app
This is a simple React application that displays a list of products with their respective images, names, and prices. Users can add items to a cart by clicking on an "Add to Cart" button, and the number of items in the cart is displayed next to the button. The application uses React Context to manage the state of the cart across components. The product data is stored in an array, and the product images are imported from local image files.
